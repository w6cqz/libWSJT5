A library based upon code modified from WSJT and original creation code of W6CQZ providing
encoding/decoding of JT65A protocol messages.

This code is licensed under GPL 2.0 if you don't know what that means to your program if
you use this - please keep reading.


Simple explanation.

Please do not use this code in a closed source program or a partially closed source
program.  It's just going to cause troubles if you do - if not from myself, certainly
so from others who watch these things.

libJT65 is licensed under the GPL 2 - this was not my choice, it is required as
it is derived from WSJT (GPL 2) and its ties to FFTW3 also strengthen its GPL lock.

To have this under any other license allowing its use in closed source programs
would require that you receive a license from Joe Taylor - K1JT and, if you could
do that, a license from Joe Large - W6CQZ for my portion of unique creation code
involved in this and either a non-gpl license for FFTW3 or removal of it as FFT base.
I can't grant a modified license to code I don't hold copyright to nor can another
grant a modified license to my code.

It's very simple.  If you use this library you are invoking the GPL 2 upon your
ENTIRE program and there's no wiggle room on this.  My code was not created under
an academic or government setting or, that I know of, anything else that allows an
invalidation of its GPL 2 status.  Much as I am constrained by using GPL code in what
I can do - anyone using this code will face the same.
